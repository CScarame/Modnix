Manual Setup Package for Modnix
</h1>
<p>
   <a href="https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix">Modnix</a>
   is a program for loading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(video_games)">mods</a>
   into <a href="https://phoenixpoint.info/">Phoenix Point</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Generally, you should use the <a href="https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix/releases">Installer</a> first.
   But when things don't work out, follow these steps for a manual setup:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      Reboot computer.
   <li>
      Find "game code folder".
      Default to <pre>C:\Program Files\Epic Games\PhoenixPoint\PhoenixPointWin64_Data\Managed</pre>
      You can find <pre>Assembly-CSharp.dll</pre> in it.
   <li>
      Delete all files in the code folder.
      Then go up two levels to find <pre>UnityPlayer.dll</pre>,
      again deleting all files.
      (Leave the folders alone.)
   <li>
      From the game launcher (EGS or Steam), do Verify Files.
   <li>
      Launch the game and make sure it works.  Exit game.
   <li>
      Explore <pre>%UserProfile%\Documents</pre>, and creates the folders <pre>My Games\Phoenix Point\Mods</pre>.
      This is the "mod folder".
   <li>
      Move extracted <pre>Modnix.exe</pre> from this package into "mod folder".
   <li>
      Find the <pre>Managed</pre> folder from this package, move its files into the "game code folder".
      Nothing should be overwritten if you cleared the folder in step 3.
   <li>
      Double-click <pre>ModnixInjector.exe</pre>, which has just been moved.
      It should says "Injection complete!"
   <li>
      Basic setup complete.  Launch the moved <pre>Modnix.exe</pre> and see how it goes.
</ol>
<p>
   Some mods may not work with a basic setup.
   See <a href="https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix/wiki/Manual-Setup">wiki</a>
   for how to solve them, and/or other troubleshoot guides.
