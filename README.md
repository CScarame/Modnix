# Modnix Point

A tool to load [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony)-based mods to Snapshot Games' Phoenix Point.

Modnix Point is based on RealityMachina's [Phoenix Point Mod Injector](https://github.com/RealityMachina/PhoenixPointModInjector/),
combined with experience learned from [ModTek](https://github.com/BattletechModders/ModTek).

This is a work in progress, valid only for further development.
