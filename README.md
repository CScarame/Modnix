# Modnix

⮞⮞⮞ [Downloads](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix/releases) ⮜⮜⮜

Modnix is a mod loader and mod manager for [Phoenix Point](https://phoenixpoint.info/), [Snapshot Games](http://www.snapshotgames.com/) 2019.

Supporting all three mod formats,
it is designed to succeed (replace) [Phoenix Point](https://github.com/RealityMachina/PhoenixPointModInjector/#readme) [Mod Loader](https://github.com/Ijwu/PhoenixPointModLoader/)s.

Modnix is open source and under development,
but should be mature enough to be tested by developers and power users.

## User Features

1. Easy to use.  One-click setup, simple mod manager, detailed diagnostic Log.
2. Advanced mods, such as *real* Skip Intro, and can load *both* PPML 0.1 and 0.2 mods.
3. Quick access to mod files, communities, resources, and of course the game.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix/wiki#wiki-wrapper) for documentation,
such as [User Guide](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix/wiki/User-Guide#wiki-wrapper)
and [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix/wiki/Troubleshooting-Modnix#wiki-wrapper).

## Modder Features

1. Mods can be built to support PPML, Modnix, and any future tools, without explicit Modnix dependency.
2. Each mod can have their own folder, not necessary at the root.
3. Display mod information to users, such as author and links, with embedded or stand-alone info file.
4. Declarative mod dependencies and conflicts.  Opt-in pre-splash loading.
5. Unified background logger. Query function for game version, loader version, and mod versions.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix/wiki#wiki-wrapper) for mod specs.

See my [Skip Intro](https://github.com/Sheep-y/PhoenixPt-Mods/tree/master/QoL/SkipIntro) mod for an example of
dual PPML/Modnix support and embedded mod info.

You can try to get support on the #mods channel on [official Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/phoenixpoint).
