Modnix is a mod loader for [Phoenix Point](https://phoenixpoint.info/), [Snapshot Games](http://www.snapshotgames.com/) 2019.

Featuring a GUI with support for advanced mods,
it is designed to succeed (replace) [Phoenix Point](https://github.com/RealityMachina/PhoenixPointModInjector/#readme) [Mod Loader](https://github.com/Ijwu/PhoenixPointModLoader/)s.

Modnix is under active development, and mature enough to be tested by developers and power users.

## User Features

1. Mods can be built to support PPML, Modnix, and any future tools (no explicit dependency).
2. Each mod can have their own folder, not necessary at the root.

4. Declarative mod dependencies and conflicts.  Opt-in pre-splash loading.
